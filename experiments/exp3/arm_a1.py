"""A1 — Centralized FL with uniform per-round client sampling.

Per the implementation plan §4.2 EX-3.1: a measured-arm wrapper around
the centralized-FL path. There is no mule, no scheduler, no selector.
Each round samples ``client_fraction · N`` clients uniformly at random
(without replacement) and "aggregates" their updates if they meet the
deadline.

Why a sim rather than driving the real Flower path:

* The paper experiment compares scheduling *strategies*, not the
  framework's wall-clock; the centralized FL arm acts as the upper
  bound on what aggregation looks like with no mule.
* Wiring real Flower into the trial-grid would dominate the run-time
  budget for marginal added signal — the paper's claim is the
  *ratio* of yield / fairness across A1–A4, which the simulator
  reproduces deterministically.

The driver's CSV row carries the federation-side metrics (update
yield, coverage, fairness, entropy, round-close at three kmin
thresholds); mule-only metrics (ρ_contact, propulsion, Pass-2) are
reported as ``None``.
